All notable changes are recorded here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.1.0] - Unreleased

### Fixed
- Customiser: the sticky preview no longer slides over the contrast checks or traps the scroll wheel. Contrast and export now sit below the whole layout, and a live contrast summary sits beside the preview. A browser test covers it.
- `lk-stepper` with many steps or long names no longer squashes its labels: it goes compact (current label only, others kept for screen readers) when there are more than five steps.

### Added
- `rise-test/`: one self-contained page that checks which browser features work inside a Rise course (the `hidden` attribute, dialogs, popovers, custom elements, modules, storage, modern CSS, clipboard, resizing, network), and writes a plain-text report to send back. Nothing runs against the internet unless a button is pressed.
- `<lk-flow>`: a process chart or decision tree drawn from nested lists, with branches that rejoin, a `tree` layout, and an optional walk-through that highlights the route. Graph and walk logic in `core/flow.js`.
- Navigation components: `<lk-menu>` (dropdown with arrow keys, type-ahead and top-layer placement), `<lk-tree>` (WAI-ARIA tree with roving focus, for course outlines) and `<lk-drawer>` (a modal dialog docked to one side). Logic in `core/keys.js`, `core/tree.js` and `alignedPosition` in `core/position.js`.
- Learning components: `<lk-flashcards>` (missed cards come round again), `<lk-order>` (put items in sequence, with buttons, drag and word-based marking) and `<lk-hotspot>` (numbered points on a picture or diagram). Logic in `core/flashcards.js`, `core/order.js` and `core/spots.js`.
- Display components, modelled on the MudBlazor catalogue: `<lk-table>` (sort, filter, striped), `<lk-alert>`, `<lk-chip>`, `<lk-avatar>`, `<lk-switch>`, `<lk-breadcrumbs>`, `<lk-pagination>`, and CSS-only `.lk-card`, `.lk-divider` and `.lk-skeleton`. Logic in `core/table.js` and `core/widgets.js`.
- Project foundation: `LkElement` base class, utilities, design tokens and base stylesheet.
- `<lk-tabs>` component.
- `<lk-accordion>` component, with Homepage theme styling.
- `<lk-modal>` component, built on native `<dialog>`, with Homepage theme styling.
- Theme structure: cascade layers (`lk.tokens`, `lk.components`, `lk.theme`), `data-lk-theme` and `data-lk-mode` attributes, and a wider token contract.
- `homepage` theme, based on the Homepage design system.
- `<lk-timeline>`, `<lk-grid-explorer>`, `<lk-process>` and `<lk-scenario>`.
- `<lk-spectrum>` comparison spectrum and `<lk-rating>` self-assessment.
- `<lk-journal>` reflection journal with autosave, copy and download.
- `<lk-quiz>` knowledge check from markup or JSON, with scoring logic in `core/quiz.js`.
- `toast()` and `<lk-toasts>` notifications.
- `<lk-tooltip>` and `<lk-popover>`, with `core/position.js` for placement.
- `<lk-progress>` and `<lk-stepper>`.
- `<lk-field>` and `<lk-choices>` form controls with labels, hints, errors and validation.
- `.lk-button` and `.lk-badge` classes, status colour tokens (`success`, `warning`, `danger`, `info`), and `core/contrast.js`.
- Node tests that check every theme's contrast in light and dark, and an in-browser component test runner (`test/browser/`).
- Customiser at `/customiser/`: start from any theme, edit tokens with a live preview and contrast checks, export CSS. Export logic in `core/customise.js`.
- Theme gallery at `/gallery/`, and `data-lk-mode="light"` plus `color-scheme` so native controls follow the mode.
- `contrast` (AAA), `bold` and `soft` themes.
- `clean` theme: a modern, rounded look in light and dark, added with no component changes.
- Examples, documentation and unit tests for core helpers.
