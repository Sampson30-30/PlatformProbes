# LearnKit

Dependency-free Web Components: accessible UI primitives, plus interactive components for learning content. No framework, no build step: add a script and a stylesheet, then write HTML.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="learnkit.css" />
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>

<lk-tabs label="Course sections">
  <div data-lk-tab="Overview">Start here.</div>
  <div data-lk-tab="Details">Go deeper.</div>
</lk-tabs>
```

LearnKit is a free UI shop with three layers: **components**, **themes** that give any component a complete look, and a **customiser** to make a theme your own. Available themes: `homepage`, `clean`, `contrast`, `bold` and `soft`.

## Principles

- **No dependencies and no build step.** Plain ES modules and CSS.
- **Accessible by default.** Keyboard support, ARIA roles, visible focus, reduced motion respected.
- **Themeable.** Override any `--lk-*` token, or load a whole theme. See [docs/theming.md](docs/theming.md).
- **Light DOM.** Style with ordinary CSS. Content stays readable by search engines and assistive technology.
- **Content as markup or data.** Authors do not need to write JavaScript.

## Try it

```sh
npm start        # serves the repo at http://localhost:8080
# the home page links to everything: examples, gallery, customiser, docs and tests
npm test         # unit tests for helpers, plus contrast checks for every theme
# component tests run in the browser: open /test/browser/
```

## Documentation

- [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md)
- [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md)
- [Theming](docs/theming.md)
- Theme gallery: run `npm start`, then open `/gallery/`
- Customiser: run `npm start`, then open `/customiser/`

## Platform

The `platform` branch also holds a site built with LearnKit that teaches an engineering way of working to people who build learning content. See [platform/README.md](platform/README.md) and [platform/ROADMAP.md](platform/ROADMAP.md).
